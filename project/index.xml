      <description>######Introduction
I chose my datasets after scouring the data library that R already has installed. I liked a pair of datasets fivethirtyeight had to offer and it met the criteria for the project. Both datasets are related to each other.The first dataset contains employment and income information based on majors for undergrads. The second datasets contains the same information but graduate level students. Furthermore, the second dataset also contains wage and employment information for students who attended graduate school but did not graduate, unlike the the undergraduate dataset which only contains data for graduated students.</description>

In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
